**helping_functions.py**  
Implements some helping functions in order to split the data, determine the timeseries format (t,t+1). The previous values that we want to take into cinsideration in order to predict the next value in the time serie is defined by us. Also preprocessing functions like filling the missing values, and mainly making the appropriate format for feeding different types of neural networks.

**lstm.py**  
A Long-Short-Term-Memory Neural Network for predicting values in timeseries. This is an implementation that follows our first approach to deal with sequential data. Our first approach was a Recurrent Neural Network, which is known that it has problems with the short term and long term memory. This happens because of the gradient vanish as we go from the last to the first layers. The aforementioned procedure has as an outcome that the first layers of the NN does not learn at all. We can overcome this obstacle implementing a procedure that provide us Long and Short term memory, because the previous event are important and we need longer dependencies for our data. Because of this we implement the LSTM and the GRU, know as Gated Recurrent Units, which are represent exactly this procedure of giving memory to the network.
