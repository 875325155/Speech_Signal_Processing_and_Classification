**helping_functions.py** Implements some helping functions in order to split the data, determine the timeseries format (t,t+1). The previous values that we want to take into cinsideration in order to predict the next value in the time serie is defined by us. Also preprocessing functions like filling the missing values, and mainly making the appropriate format for feeding different types of neural networks.
